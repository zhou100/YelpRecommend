But it hasn't always been easy for our allergy whenever we ate out. So we called Delmonico ahead to see if they can accommodate our special needs. The lady who answered our call was very courteous and we felt comfortable to try after having some answers from her.\\r\\nAs we arrived, the restaurant has a comfortable ambience. I wouldn't say it is grand or special but just comfortable. When it was time to order, the server was courteous regarding our allergy too and I believe the one who took care of us was a manager. He even checked with the chef to make sure the complimentary popover was okay for us to consume. We told them we are allergic to soy, corn, peanut, tomato and pork products, and some other stuff, and he had been very mindful and advised accordingly as we ordered, he did it so graciously that we didn't feel being put in a spot. Some other semi high end restaurants had given us a startled face or even an uncomfortable face when we mentioned our allergy, but this manager was super professional that he didn't make us feel crappy about our differences from others. So he made a potential stressful situation easy for us, very impressive.\\r\\nTheir steak was aged in house by the restaurant and we think their aging was done fabulously as there was no rotten smell or taste in it. The manager even double checked with us and informed us that the beef was sourced from corn fed cows and asked if we would be able to tolerate that. And we made our decision to say yes and went ahead with the steak. Their steaks were very delicious. We actually asked for medium well with no seasoning and the steak still came out super delicious and juicy. So the good quality is in the steak itself and didn't need to depend on seasoning or being served bloodily. Again, very impressive.\\r\\nAnyway, it was a delicious meal and we were well taken care of so we didn't get sick from any event of undisclosed allergens. We are very happy with this meal. We would go back when we have another time wanting to treat ourselves again. Hopefully the manager will be there again the next time we visit.\"],\n",

Crust could be a bit thinner/crispier but, with all that cheese it's still very delicious.  For the price, quality, and flavor on sandwiches, pizza, or wings, you cannot beat it.

      "\r\n",
      "Firstly, they arranged to have their limo come pick us up from the hotel right at 4:45p for a 5:00p reservation - nice. The driver was right on time! The drive over to the restaurant was a little longer than anticipated (I had mapped it out at only 3 miles from the hotel) but apparently there was major construction underway on Trop so he had to go an alternative route to avoid that. He gave us a heads up before we arrived that they were in the process of remodeling the restaurant - oh ok. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As we walked in, there were a few tables already occupied but, upon being seated for a few minutes, we realized it was DEAD quiet. Strangely no music (I had envisioned old Blue Eyes crooning in the background as we were sipping our wine and looking at the historic Vegas photos on the walls). Our server informed us that because of the construction, their music system was disconnected. That definitely reduced the \"ambiance\" factor, but about 15 or 20 minutes in, their live music duo started to play oldies. I enjoyed it, but my BF thought it was cheesy LOL.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anyway, on to the menu - many choices from chicken to meat to pasta! We ended up ordering bruschetta and a simple salad to start, the mussels appetizer, and 1 lb. of spaghetti (yes a whole pound - we've never seen that anywhere!) with pomodoro. The bruschetta was awesome, the spaghetti was pretty decent, and the mussels dish was nice as well (mostly because of the yummy sauce) although they were the big green lip - I prefer the smaller ones.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were pretty full so decided to pass on dessert (didn't want to be falling asleep at the concert). By the time we finished, we were right on time to get with our driver again for the drive back to Hard Rock. Smooth sailing, tipped driver and bid him farewell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, it was an enjoyable meal but we definitely came at an awkward time because of the remodeling. I think I'd like to return to this off-the-beaten-path restaurant after the expansion is complete to get a more accurate experience. I actually may return next month when my Mom and I will be there for a 2-night getaway. Saluti!\n",

      "Waited over 20 minutes, tried giving us the wrong order. Cook threw the wrong order in the trash. Turned around and started cooking again, no apology. We waited another 15 min while behind us are now getting their food. I politely asked the man behind the register an update on our food. I even started with \"I know you guys are under staffed and very busy...\". He gave me a refund which then I explained to him that I didn't want a refund, I just wanted to know what was going on with my food. He gave us a refund, we took, he offered to make us our food still, free of charge. Our time was up, we had to go. An apology would have been nice.\n",

Very accommodating and anticipated our every need! The next is their sushi chefs!... they work their butts off... one guys appropriately from Japan...FRESH SUSHI HERE people!... of all the restaurants in Vegas, this is one of my favorites!!! Great job guys, keep it up!!! Thank you for such a consistently wonderful experience!!!\n",

The menu is very well designed with plenty of customization or you can choose from combinations they have already thought out. These are the best poke/sushi burritos I have had, not just in Las Vegas either. This place has a great reputation and you can see why if you choose to come here.

Jaburritos is near the Linq on the strip, and was super convenient for lunch while we were walking around. The staff were all really helpful with what to order and the food was delicious - fresh fish, and great amount of topping options. This is a nice alternative to poke (which you would have to travel off the strip for), especially when you've been drinking and want something easy to eat (without a fork, lol)! I would definitely come here again the next time I visit!\n",

I mentioned this to the manager and he went to remove it. Then he explained that the roach came from outside. while I understand this, the fact is, the roach was now inside the restaurant.  I was really tempted to leave right then. However, we stuck it out. DH ordered chicken pho, and I ordered rice vermicelli  with grilled pork and egg rolls.  The food was tasty, but we did note that the soup broth has MSG and felt the dizzying effects of it afterward.  Service was friendly and fast.  I have to say, the roads encounter colored the whole experience.  Hoping that's a really isolated incident.\n",
